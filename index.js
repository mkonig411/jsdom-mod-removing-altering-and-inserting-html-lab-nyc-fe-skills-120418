/* Enter the code to remove the main node element under this comment */

/* Create your new element here and assign it to newHeader */
const newHeader = null;



* Remove the `main` element.
* Add an H1 with `id` of `victory` programmatically, using JavaScript. Inside
  the tag you should put "(your name) is the champion!"

Inside `index.js`, you'll see JavaScript comments telling you where to put the
code. Run the tests with `learn`. When they pass, use `learn submit` to move
on! Congratulations.
